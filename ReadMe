Neural Network-Based Framework for Risk Mapping of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Using Remote Sensing and GIS


ðŸ“„ Submitted to Environmental Research Communications

Study Overview

This work presents an integrated framework for the risk mapping of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL), designed to capture the complex interactions between ecological drivers and disease distribution. The framework is implemented in three sequential phases:
1.	Generation of disease and environmental maps to ensure precise and reliable spatial inputs.
2.	Statistical analysis of ecologicalâ€“epidemiological associations using correlation and regression techniques.
3.	Neural networkâ€“based modeling for the production of high-resolution predictive risk maps.
The approach leverages:
